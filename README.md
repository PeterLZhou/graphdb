# graphdb

This research project was done under the supervision of Professor Avi Silberschatz and Assistant Professor Wenjun Hu. The goal was to examine search efficiency and feasability in using an object-oriented tagging system when designing nodes in a graph database. The server for this application was written in django and the graph database structure comes from Neo4j.
